# Album Aggregator

## Introduction
The Album Aggregator is a Python tool designed to fetch, process, and analyze album data from multiple sources. It is built for music industry analysts, record labels, and anyone interested in understanding music trends and artist performance over time.

## Key Features
This application provides several functionalities to assist in music data analysis:

- **Data Aggregation**: Gathers album data from specified online APIs.
- **Data Processing**: Filters and organizes album data based on release dates and other metrics.
- **Genre Popularity Analysis**: Calculates and displays the popularity of music genres based on the gathered data.
- **Artist Performance Comparison**: Compares artists based on specified metrics such as average album ratings.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves processed data into CSV files for further analysis or reporting.

## System Requirements
Before installation, ensure your system meets the following specifications:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Dependencies: `requests`, `pandas`

## Installation Guide

### Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   If Git is not installed, install it first, then run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/album-aggregator.git
   cd album-aggregator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

### Configuration
- **API Setup**: Edit the `sources` list in the `AlbumAggregator` class with the actual API endpoints from which to fetch the album data.

## Running the Application
Start the application with the following command:
   ```bash
   python album_aggregator.py
   ```

## Detailed Code Explanation
### `AlbumAggregator` Class
This class is the backbone of the application, orchestrating the fetching, processing, and analysis of album data.

#### `fetch_data` Method
- **Function**: Iterates through each source URL, fetches album data via HTTP GET requests, and compiles the data into a list.
- **Error Handling**: Includes try-except to manage exceptions related to network issues or API errors.

#### `process_data` Method
- **Purpose**: Filters albums released from a specified date (e.g., '2024-01-01') and prepares them for analysis.
- **Implementation**: Uses `pandas` DataFrame to manage and manipulate the album data efficiently.

#### `genre_popularity` Method
- **Functionality**: Analyzes the frequency of each music genre in the dataset to determine genre popularity.
- **Output**: Returns a Series object with genre counts, sorted by popularity.

#### `artist_comparison` Method
- **Description**: Groups data by artist and calculates the mean of a specified metric (e.g., 'rating') for each artist, sorting the results to highlight top performers.

#### `save_data` Method
- **Purpose**: Saves any DataFrame to a CSV file, allowing for easy sharing and further analysis outside the Python environment.

## Troubleshooting
- **API Connection Issues**: Ensure your network settings allow connections to the APIs and that the URLs are correct.
- **Dependency Errors**: If Python packages fail to import, verify their installation or reinstall them as needed.

## FAQs
- **Q: Can the application handle data from any music API?**
  - A: The application can handle any JSON API that provides data in a compatible format. Adjust the parsing logic in `fetch_data` if the API structure differs.
- **Q: How can I use the output files?**
  - A: The CSV files can be used in spreadsheet applications, imported into databases, or analyzed using other data analysis tools.
